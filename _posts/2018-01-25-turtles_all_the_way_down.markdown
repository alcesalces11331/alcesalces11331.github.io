## The Easy and the Long
There is an easy answer and there is a long answer as to why I decided to learn software development. I must admit, the superficialities of being a software developer will greatly increase the standard of my life. But, to say I started learning software development merely for a tangible life benefit would devalue the immense possibilities -- and opportunities -- software development provides. A more profound reason lies behind the immediate allure of software developing; a reason  which, in essence, emulates *turtles all the way down* unmoved mover paradox.

## To Stand on the Shoulders of Giants
Beyond the essential tools of web-development we reach back-end development. Further inside back-end development we start reading directly from the processor(s). And then, beyond that? Principles and practices of electro-magnetic theory, similar to how neurons communicate. That said -- and with a breadth of excusable lack of knowledge -- being a software developer is a stepping stone into a much large pond. It lays the foundations to become familiar with programming principles, much like we have to walk before we can run. But I mean to fly, and that means wings I'll have to build. I mean to stand on the shoulders of giants and to use their height to, hopefully, comprehend a little more the questions and challenges proposed by the plethora of conditions of the 21st century. 

The inertia of the past few hundred years of technological advancement are too great to stop. It is too late for a primitivist solution, however idyllic it may be. That may be our future, if not our present. To reach the point of a sustainable, progressive, human condition means we must reshape the fabric of the present world. Society itself requires reshaping, and, politics aside, a breakthrough in artificial intelligence may be the factor we need. If humans are too caught up in superficial ideological struggles within and without borders, where to do we look? With all of our chips already placed within the hand of technology, we are required to play it through to the end. 

Looking around, we're already seeing this perspective play out. With companies such as Tesla, SpaceX, Blue Origin, Alphabet, to name only a few, the focus is on *how technology may dig us out of the errors of the past*. Resources already scarce are becoming scarcer and resources once abundant are becoming polluted and scarce. Already we're noticing the effects of human consumption on water within South Africa and the Middle-East. The end-game scenario of societies without water **will only end in detriment** for those countries and those around them. It's a global game, and I say, put our pieces in technology which will, albeit naively hopefully, be our second coming. 

## To the Universe and Beyond

Towards that end, software development, for me, is a pond to strengthen my understanding of programming principles and allow myself the opportunity to work towards a better future. I want to study machine learning and get us one step closer to bridging the gap between realty and science-fiction. I firmly believe this inertia is beyond our divided might to counteract. However, maybe we can guide the forces towards this future and finally put ourselves into the furthest stars. This is hope. This is, to quote, Buzz Lightyear:
