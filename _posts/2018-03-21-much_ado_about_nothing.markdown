## A step-by-step guide to go from nothing to something (1)

We've all been there. The moment when you're staring at a blank, flashing vertical column within a console. It's flashing, ready to receive commands to build whatever it is we want to build (and know how to build). The only trouble is how do we get from nothing to something? How do we proceed from an idea and develope it into a functional library, for instance. 

I like to think of building any program as you would build a castle. Ok, not the best metaphor, since how many of us build castles? Regardless, building a castle requires laying one brick at a time. It is this one-brick-at-a-time approach to creating a program I will go over in this, and future, blog posts. 

### From the console to the editor

To begin, look at the flashing column within the console. It's begging to be commanded. Here, the idea is still only an abstract concept, an ethereal, incorporeal form. Bringing it into the computer requires answering the question: what does the completed program need to do? Once this is answered, the path towards how we get there will be the blueprint we'll follow.

Let's lay some bricks. What do we need first? Is this a file or a directory? Create this first. This step is laying the groundwork for our future coding, the foundation for all that comes after. This is important. Having a well thoughtout layout for our code enables us to seamlessly move from functionality to functionality. This is really what we're trying to do, right? A program is a bunch of put together bundles of functionalities working together. Yet, it it's put together all wonky, the program will be ripe for errors, anti-patterns, noise, and smells. All the smells.

Create the parent directory and name it the name of the program. Create some children directories, like your bin, config, db, lib... etc. And then! create the README.md. 

Voila! The foundation is finished and the fun stuff is just beginning.
