From the moment I learned about OO programing, I've been seeing its applications everywhere. It's provided a new perspective from which to view the world we interact with on a daily basis. It's evident in our social media apps, to our streaming sites, to the video games we play. I thought I would be surpised. I was not. This makes perfect sense when we think about the functionality  of Objects. Objects provide us the framework from which our code to interact with *itself*. We need our code talking to itself; referencing files and programs, persisting and saving sessions. It absolutely cannot be linear, because what if we want our applications to do something else? Like, say, transition from one screen to the next without a loading screen.

Think of class World, which would provide functionality when the character is exploring the world's environment. We're going to need classes to interact with each other as the character's location is altered. It's going to have to encapsulate an immense amount of data, which may just be sent to other class's and their methods and then returned to view. When the character(s) interact with each other requires its own set of objects and methods for how they will iteract (and then subsequently rendered and so forth). Perhaps its an exchange of an item, as in a trade, which would require an updating of each person's stash. I can only imagine the level of validation and authentication to prevent most trivial modifications to the base code. We have objects on top of objects and again I am reminded of turtles all the way down. 

Perhaps it would be easier to visualize it in the labs and lessons Flatiron is providing. Their exploration of utilizing features of objects gets more and more abstract as we progress through the program. Simple objects with simple methods become full feature applications for managing finances, for example. The Sinatra leg of the program features and expanding object oriented base, exposing the student to what exactly OO programming is capable of, without just tossing them into a database far beyond what we are ready for. I, for one, and super excited, and can barely contain myself with enthusiasm, for furthering my understanding of Sinatra into Rails and whatever may lie beyond.
